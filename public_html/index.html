            <div id="about"><!--A short bio about me and my goals-->
                <p>
                    I am Taber Storm; I am a programmer currently in school working towards a B.S. degree in Computer Science.
                    I work part time in an IT job for my school.
                    I am currently expanding my skill set by making a web-site, and have many goals for the future of this web-site.
                    Eventually I would like this site to be able to share experiences and comment about thing I have done.
                </p>    

                <p>
                    Currently this site is built by adding content to an HTML document, 
                    styling and positioning the content in a CSS document, 
                    and dynamically showing/hiding content and changing styles using JQuery in a JavaScript file.               
                </p>
                <p>Here is a list of plans I have.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I will make this page pretty and interesting by adding graphics and more content.</li>
                    <li>I will complete the Gm Tools and add it to the android marketplace and make it available for free with no adds.</li>
                    <li>I will re-work some of my previous programs, expanding my TRP Adventure game and adding graphics.</li>
                    <li>I will make an web-site based game that will be showcased and made available for play on this web-site.</li>
                    <li>I will test with other languages such as C#, Phython, and any others that may peak my interest.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>P.S. For those of you wondering about my favicon it holds my initials TSF. Its like a mini logo for me.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="projects"><!--Stuff i am working on currently-->
                <p>This will give a summary of the projects I have completed and which ones I am working on working on.</p>
                <a href="CrypTrd.html" class="blue click"><span class='CRPTD'>Cryptsy Trader</span></a>
                <p>
                    This is an android application that me and my partner Seth made 
                    as a class project. <a href="CrypTrd.html" class="blue click"> <b class="CRPTD">Cryptsy Trader.</b></a>
                    This is a crypto currency app that interfaces with the Cryptsy API. 
                    The app allows you to check your balances, order history, active orders, and allows you to place orders.
                    This was done by interfacing with the Cryptsy website through HTTP post.
                    It uses your key and secrete to authenticate, and these can be set using the QR scanner.
                    
                </p>
                <a href="TRP.html" class="blue click"><span class="TRP">TRP</span></a>
                <p>
                    I have made a small sample game called <a href="TRP.html" class="blue click"><b class="TRP">TRP.</b></a> This is a top down dungeon dive game composed in the console using ASCII graphics.
                    The Hero can be named and has three stats: Health, Sword Power, and Magic Power. 
                    The game allows the user to maneuver the character through a 2-dimensional character array and displays the content to the screen.
                    
                </p>
                <a href="GM.html" class="blue click"><span class="GM">GM Tools</span></a>
                <p>
                    I have an app in progress for the Android <a href="GM.html" class="blue click"> <b class="GM">Gm Tools.</b></a>
                    The tools will keep track of the characters initiative.
                    It will store basic information about the characters.
                    It will have a text random dice roller.
