                <p>
                    I am Taber Storm; I am a programmer currently in school working towards a B.S. degree in Computer Science.
                    I work part time in an IT job for my school.
                    I am currently expanding my skill set by making a web-site, and have many goals for the future of this web-site.
                    Eventually I would like this site to be able to share experiences and comment about thing I have done.
                </p>    

                <p>
                    Currently this site is built by adding content to an HTML document, 
                    styling and positioning the content in a CSS document, 
                    and dynamically showing/hiding content and changing styles using JQuery in a JavaScript file.               
                </p>
                <p>Here is a list of plans I have.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I will make this page pretty and interesting by adding graphic and more content.</li>
                    <li>I will complete the Gm Tools and add it to the android marketplace and make it available for free with no adds.</li>
                    <li>I will re-work some of my previous programs, expanding my TRP Adventure game and adding graphics.</li>
                    <li>I will make an web-site based game that will be showcased and made available for play on this web-site.</li>
                    <li>I will test with other languages such as C#, Phython, and any others that may peak my interest.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>P.S. For those of you wondering about my favicon it holds my initials TSF. Its like a mini logo for me.</p>

                <p>This will give a summary of the projects I have completed and which ones I am working on working on.</p>

                <p>
                    I have made a small sample game called <a href="TRP.html" class="blue"><b class="TRP">TRP.</b></a> This is a top down dungeon dive game composed in the console using ASCII graphics.
                    The Hero can be named and has three stats: Health, Sword Power, and Magic Power. 
                    The game allows the user to maneuver the character through a 2-dimensional character array and displays the content to the screen.

                <a href="GM.html" class="blue"><span class="GM">GM Tools</span></a>
                <p>
                    I have an app in progress for the Android <a href="GM.html" class="blue"> <b class="GM">Gm Tools.</b></a>
                    The tools will keep track of the characters initiative.
                    It will store basic information about the characters.
                    It will have a text random dice roller.
