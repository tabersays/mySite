<div><!--This houses the a description of the program and has pictures showing the program in use.-->
    <p> This is an android application that me and my partner Seth made
        as a class project.This is a crypto currency app that interfaces with the Cryptsy API.
        The app allows you to check your balances, order history, active orders, and allows you to place orders.
        This was done by interfacing with the Cryptsy website through HTTP post in the android's async tasks.
        It uses your key and secrete to authenticate, and these can be set using the QR scanner.
        This app has small banner adds.

    <p>If you want the app, it can be found:</p>
