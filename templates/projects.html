    <p>This will give a summary of the projects I have completed and which ones I am working on working on.</p>
    <a href="#crypTrd">Cryptsy Trader</a>

    <p>
        This is an android application that me and my partner Seth made
        as a class project. <a href="#crypTrd"> Cryptsy Trader.</a>
        This is a crypto currency app that interfaces with the Cryptsy API.
        The app allows you to check your balances, order history, active orders, and allows you to place orders.
        This was done by interfacing with the Cryptsy website through HTTP post.
        It uses your key and secrete to authenticate, and these can be set using the QR scanner.

    <a href="#tabersRolePlay">TRP</a>

    <p>
        I have made a small sample game called <a href="#tabersRolePlay">TRP.</a> This is
        a top down dungeon dive game composed in the console using ASCII graphics.
        The Hero can be named and has three stats: Health, Sword Power, and Magic Power.
        The game allows the user to maneuver the character through a 2-dimensional character array and displays the
        content to the screen.

    <a href="#gameMaster">GM Tools</a>

    <p>
        I have an app in progress for the Android <a href="#gameMaster">Gm Tools.</a>
        The tools will keep track of the characters initiative.
        It will store basic information about the characters.
        It will have a text random dice roller.
