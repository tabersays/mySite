    Description:

dont want to slow down loading times as my website expands

<div><!--This houses the a description of the program and has pictures showing the program in use.-->

    <p> I have made a small sample game called TRP. This is a top down dungeon dive game composed in the console using
        ASCII graphics.
        The Hero can be named and has three stats: Health, Sword Power, and Magic Power.
        The game allows the user to maneuver the character through a 2-dimensional character array and displays the
        content to the screen.
        This game supports basic saving and loading of characters. It does this by saving the data to a file in a
        specific order.
        Then on load it reads it back in the same order.

        <p>This is the title screen. Load works by grabbing a DAT file named with the hero's name.</p>
